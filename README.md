**Problem Statement**
Our project has the goal to help improve farmers' production yield of cassava in Brazil and countries of sub-Saharan Africa by building a cassava disease identifier model running on OAK-D.

Cassava is called the food of the 21st century by the UN (Embrapa). It is consumed by around 700 million people worldwide but most of the consumers are located in the poorest countries in the world (Embrapa). Despite being originally from South America, Cassava has become a staple food in Africa. The plant is very rich in carbohydrates and survives very harsh weather and soil conditions. Cassava provides the 3rd highest carbohydrate yield among crop plants in tropics (wordatlas). In Africa it provides the 2nd highest carbohydrate yield among crops. It is so resistant that soils with pH ranging from acidic to alkaline can’t stop it from growing (wordatlas). There is no problem if it rains too little or too much. It can survive on 50mm to 5m rainfall in a year (wordatlas). It does not need sunblock. It survives on equatorial temperatures (wordatlas). If that was not enough to believe how tough this plant is, it can survive on elevations between sea-level and 6600 feet high (wordatlas). Because of its resistance and high source of carbohydrates, it provides carbohydrates to the most impoverished regions of the world. To put that in perspective, cassava trade is responsible for 46% of the GDP in Ghana. It is both a cash and subsistence crop in such impoverished countries. That is why it is called the food of the 21st century by the UN. However, pests, disease and weed can reduce its economic yield by 50% (fao). The current method used  to identify the plant disease requires agriculture experts to do so. That is costly, slow, labor intense, and dependent on a limited number of experts. We want to solve this yield issue by detecting common diseases on the cassava leaves with OAK-D.

We already have access to labeled images from two Kaggle challenges: 9,436 on challenge one and 21,367 on challenge two. There are also 12,595 unlabeled images of cassava leaves on challenge one. We also have access to a few researches regarding cassava disease identification such as iCassava 2019 Fine-Grained Visual Categorization. This shows our team already have enough material to begin and complete a full model of leaf disease detection but we will also be looking for more images from agricultural institutions in Brazil and African countries such as The National Research Center for Cassava and Tropical Fruit Crops (CNPMF), Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Makerere University in Uganda, National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI), to name a few. 

OAK-D can be used by countries like Brazil or Nigeria since the purchasing power parity is higher when compared to very poor countries such as Uganda. Our team will use OAK-D to find a solution in Brazil since the members are from Brazil. However, OAK-D is not an affordable option to countries like Ghana, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, to name a few. Solving issues that involve the most poor areas in the world is not something that can be accomplished with a OAK-D $129.00 camera. There are even areas in Brasil where such technology is not affordable. If we win the contest, we would like to use the money to pursue our goal’s full scope of reaching the poorest regions in the world that can’t afford even an OAK-1 camera. The future goal of this project, if we win the contest, is to partner with OpenCV to create a more affordable camera in the future where even the poorest countries in the world could afford it while maintaining enough capability for the camera to run an AI Edge model of identifying such diseases with high accuracy.
